                Most stories you read about happened a long time ago or in a land of myth and fantasy.  This story though is real and happened only a few days ago.
                <br>
                <br>
                A short boat ferry away form Lanai, one of Hawaii's smaller islands.  A great white white rock peaks out form the waves in the deep ocean.  Polished by the wind, rain and the waves, the white rock can be seen for miles when the tide is at it's lowest.  It was a low tide in April and the stone was glimmering against the moonlight, when the light bounced off something shiny in the water and caught the attention of a fisherman.
                <br>
                <br>
                It had been a long night of fishing and the young fisherman was not sure but he thought that the sparkes he saw was the scales of a fish.  He had never seen scales which such a beautiful colour though.  Each scale was like a rainbow shimmering from the dark waves.  He rubbed his eyes, as he saw them again.
                <br>
                <br>
                He knew that none of his friends would believe a fish like this could exist.  So the next time he say the shimmering tail, he threw out his net to see if he could catch it.  The first throw of his net, he felt a strong pull - he knew he caught it.  He pulles and strained to pull his catch aboard his small boat.  He pulled and he heaved but finally.  He dragged his net aboard.
                <br>
                <br>
                "I did it!", he yelled and let out a sign of relief.  "Now everyone has to believe me that I caught - ".  He stopped mid-sentance and looked away from his haul.  He heard the crying of a small girl.  He looked off his edges of this boat into the distance and checked the wake and the waves from the boat.  Where could it be coming from?  He looked down at his net and then he saw her.
                <br>
                <br>
                She lay trapped by the ropes and fasting of the net, her hair covered by a silky and shiney pink hair that sparked under the moonlight, as if it was jewels, gems or glitter.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Oh my", he said.  "Are you okay?" pulled his net back gently off her.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Why did you do that?  Thats not nice now!" the girl shouted.  The fisherman rubbed is eyes again.  She was not a little girl - she was a mermaid.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Oh my!", he said again.  "I am so sorry!  I have never met a mermaid before". He looked at her as she sat on the edge of the boat.  "What were you doing out here?"
                <br>
                <br>
                "This is where all the mermaids meet on nights like this.  We chase eachother's tails around and around the rock.  I always loose though...  I think it is because I am so small.  That's why I am here so early to practice".  She looked down and grabbed the tips of her tail.  While the fisherman had never seen a mermaid, she did look small - even in his little boat.
                <br>
                <br>
                "How about I make you a deal, to say sorry for catching you in my net.  I will drop my net into the water."
                <br>
                <br>
                "But then I will never win the race to the bottom", she protested with a grumpy face.
                <br>
                <br>
                "You will if I cut holes in the net, just big enough that only you can fit through.  All the other mermaids will have to swim around but you will be able to slip right through!"
                <br>
                <br>
                "You mean it!", she looked up at the young fishman's face and gave him a smile.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Of course!".  The two shook hands and agreed.
                <br>
                <br>
                "A few hours later, more and more mermaids appeared.  With every colour of tail you can imagine!  Red, Green, Yellow, any colour you can think of but no mermaid was a pretty as the fisher's mermaid".
                <br>
                <br>
                The race begun and all the mermaids swam down the rock, going around and around.  As soon as she started to slip behind the bigger mermaids, he dropped the net.  Soon the plan worked!  She squeezed through the small spaces that only she could fit through and the bigger mermaids had to take a long way around.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once the race was over she swam to the top of the water.  The mermaid swam to the side of the boat.  "Thank you!  That meant more to me than you will ever know!"  She pulled the fisherman's collar and kissed him on the cheek.
                <br>
                <br>
                She slipped back into the water and swam away.  As she did, she jumped out of the water and flicked her tail.  The rainbow scales shining in the rising sun.
                <br>
                <br>
                "I can't believe it... I must have been dreaming" he said.  Sighing, "I must have been dreaming."
                <br>
                <br>
                He rowed his small boat home looking sad.  Until he noticed a hair on his shoulder, pink and glimmering in the light.  
                <br>
                <br>
                "She was real".
